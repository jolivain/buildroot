	  The diagnostic_aggregator contains a ROS node,
	  aggregator_node, that listens to
	  diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray messages on the /diagnostics
	  topic, processes and categorizes the data, and republishes
	  on /diagnostics_agg. The aggregator_node loads "Analyzer"
	  plugins to perform the diagnostics processing and
	  categorization. The configuration and setup for each
	  diagnostic aggregator is specific to each robot and can be
	  determined by users or developers.
