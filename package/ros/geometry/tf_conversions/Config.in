	  This package contains a set of conversion functions to
	  convert common tf datatypes (point, vector, pose, etc) into
	  semantically identical datatypes used by other
	  libraries. The conversion functions make it easier for users
	  of the transform library (tf) to work with the datatype of
	  their choice. Currently this package has support for the
	  Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) and the Eigen matrix
	  library.
