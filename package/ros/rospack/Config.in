	  rospack is a command-line program which provides many of the
	  services of the *NIX pkg-config tool. It is used to find
	  packages among the "forest" of code in a typical ROS
	  distribution, calculate dependencies, mangle Makefiles, and
	  in general promote peace and harmony in a ROS distribution.
