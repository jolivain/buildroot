	  bond_core metapackage: A bond allows two processes, A and B,
	  to know when the other has terminated, either cleanly or by
	  crashing. The bond remains connected until it is either
	  broken explicitly or until a heartbeat times out.

	  This metapackage selects common packages for this
	  collection.
