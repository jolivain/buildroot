	  The State Machine Compiler (SMC) from
	  http://smc.sourceforge.net/ converts a language-independent
	  description of a state machine into the source code to
	  support that state machine. This package contains the
	  libraries that a compiled state machine depends on, but it
	  does not contain the compiler itself.
