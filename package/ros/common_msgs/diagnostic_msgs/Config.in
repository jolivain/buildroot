	help
	  This package holds the diagnostic messages which provide the
	  standardized interface for the diagnostic and runtime
	  monitoring systems in ROS. These messages are currently used
	  by the diagnostics Stack, which provides libraries for
	  simple ways to set and access the messages, as well as
	  automated ways to process the diagnostic data. These
	  messages are used for long term logging and will not be
	  changed unless there is a very important reason.
