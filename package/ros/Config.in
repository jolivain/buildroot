	  The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software
	  libraries and tools that help you build robot
	  applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms,
	  and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for
	  your next robotics project. And it's all open source.

	  Note on ROS Buildroot integration:

	  ROS components are split in small ROS-packages. Those small
	  packages are sometimes grouped in a collection, into a
	  single source package or repository. Each ROS-package is
	  exposed as a single Buildroot-package, to allow minimal
	  depedencies installations. The ROS-package collections
	  exposed in Buildroot correspond to a single source
	  package. Each collection includes a meta-package with the
	  same collection name, that will install the collection
	  metadata, and a common set of packages for this collection.
	  See: http://wiki.ros.org/Metapackages
