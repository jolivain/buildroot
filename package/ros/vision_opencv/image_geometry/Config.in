	  image_geometry contains C++ and Python libraries for
	  interpreting images geometrically. It interfaces the
	  calibration parameters in sensor_msgs/CameraInfo messages
	  with OpenCV functions such as image rectification, much as
	  cv_bridge interfaces ROS sensor_msgs/Image with OpenCV data
	  types.  This contains CvBridge, which converts between ROS
	  Image messages and OpenCV images
