	help
	  This package provides a set of simple math utilities to work
	  with angles. The utilities cover simple things like
	  normalizing an angle and conversion between degrees and
	  radians. But even if you're trying to calculate things like
	  the shortest angular distance between two joint space
	  positions of your robot, but the joint motion is constrained
	  by joint limits, this package is what you need. The code in
	  this package is stable and well tested.
