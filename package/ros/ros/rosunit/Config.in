	  rosunit is an internal tool for running unit tests within
	  ROS. While it can be run by a regular user, most users will
	  generally use rosunit indirectly via rosbuild test
	  macros. The main feature that rosunit provides is
	  terminating a unit test based on a timeout and generating an
	  appropriate test failure. The rosbuild system uses this
	  feature to ensure that unit tests properly terminate.
