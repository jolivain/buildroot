	  Tools for directing, throttling, selecting, and otherwise
	  messing with ROS topics at a meta level. None of the
	  programs in this package actually know about the topics
	  whose streams they are altering; instead, these tools deal
	  with messages as generic binary blobs. This means they can
	  be applied to any ROS topic.
