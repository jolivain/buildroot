	  The nodelet package is designed to provide a way to run
	  multiple algorithms in the same process with zero copy
	  transport between algorithms. This package provides both the
	  nodelet base class needed for implementing a nodelet, as
	  well as the NodeletLoader class used for instantiating
	  nodelets.
