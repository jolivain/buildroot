	  Nodelet Core Metapackage. Nodelet Core Metapackage: it
	  contains necessary ros packages to work with ROS
	  nodelets. In ROS, each node is a process. A nodelet is
	  instead executed on a thread. The nodelet package is
	  designed to provide a way to run multiple algorithms in the
	  same process with zero copy transport between
	  algorithms. This package provides both the nodelet base
	  class needed for implementing a nodelet, as well as the
	  NodeletLoader class used for instantiating nodelets.

	  This metapackage selects common packages for this
	  collection.
