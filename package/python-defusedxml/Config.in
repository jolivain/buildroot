	  The python-defusedxml package contains several Python-only
	  workarounds and fixes for denial of service and other
	  vulnerabilities in Python's XML libraries. In order to
	  benefit from the protection you just have to import and use
	  the listed functions / classes from the right defusedxml
	  module instead of the original module.
